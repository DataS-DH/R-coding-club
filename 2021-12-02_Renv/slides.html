# renv: Package Management for R
### 2nd Dec 2021

---

class: center

# For Pythonistas
--

Life is &lt;b&gt;gooooood&lt;/b&gt; for us.  

--

Python does this very well.

--

So sit back relax and enjoy.  

--

---
# The Motivation

--

Have you ever finished a project, come back sometime later, and asked:

--

- _Why is my code now throwing an error? It worked before..._

--

- _What happened to my `ggplot2` plots?  I know they worked before..._

--

- _I re-ran the analysis, but now my results aren't the same !!!  This was right before, what is happening !!??_

--

OR

--

- _I shared my code with colleagues, but it only works on my machine.  Manager's nightmare_

--

The goal is to make sure this never happens again!

---

# Before `renv` there was `packrat`

--

&gt; _In the beginning Packrat was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move._

--

`packrat` works, but for the average user it's frustrating to use and it's challenging to recover when errors arise.

--

### &lt;center&gt;renv's goal is to be &lt;font color="red"&gt;a better Packrat&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

---

# What is `renv`?

--

`renv` is a toolkit used to manage _libraries of **R** packages_.

--

You can use `renv` to make your projects more:

--

- **Isolated**: Each project gets its own library of **R** packages, so you can upgrade and change package versions in one project without worrying about breaking your other projects.

--

- **Portable**: Because `renv` captures the state of your **R** packages within a _lockfile_, so you can more easily share and collaborate on projects with others, and ensure that everyone is working from a common base.  **More on this later**

--

- **Reproducible**: Use `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of your **R** library to the _lockfile_ `renv.lock`. You can later use `renv::restore()` to restore your **R** library exactly as specified in the lockfile.

--

`renv` attempts to prescribe a default workflow that works for most, but remains flexible enough that alternate workflows can be built on top of the tools provided by `renv`.

---

# How packages work

Let's briefly outline how **R** utilizes packages.

--

You've started a new **R** project

--

You've downloaded `dplyr`, and you're ready to load and use it in your project:

--

```r
library(dplyr)
```

--

When this code is run, **R** searches the _active library paths_ for an installed copy of the `dplyr` package, then loads it.  

--

What does this mean ? ...

--

1. What is a *library path*?

--

2. What are the _active_ library paths?

--

3. How does **R** search these library paths when loading a package?

---


# What is a Library Path?

From the [R extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Creating-R-packages) manual:

--

&gt; A directory into which packages are installed.

--

The `.libPaths()` function is used to get and set the library paths for an **R** session. For example:

--


```r
&gt; .libPaths()
[1] "C:/Users/jcrosbie/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.0"
[2] "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.0.2/library"    
```


--

In this case, I have my own **user** library, which is first in the list. This is where packages I choose to download and install normally get installed.  

--

The last library in the list is the **system** library. This is where the default packages that come with **R** are installed.

--

Each **R** session can be configured to use multiple/different library paths -- ie. multiple/different directories that **R** will search when attempting to find and load a packages.

---

# What is a Library Path?

--

**R** searches the active library paths, _in order_, to find an installation of the requested package.

--

The _first_ installation of the package that is discovered is loaded. The package's dependencies are also loaded from these same library paths.

--

**Aside** When **R** looks for a function, it will search the name space for a function of that name and use the _first_ function it finds that matches that name.  This is why colleagues, like Martine, make it explicit which library the function is from:


```r
dplr::rename( ... )
```

--

Back to our example:

--


```r
library(dplyr)
```

--

When this code is run, **R** will search the *active library paths* for an installation of the `dplyr` package, and load the first one it finds. 

--

You can use `find.package()` to search the library paths for an installed package:

--


```r
&gt; find.package("dplyr")
[1] "C:/Users/jcrosbie/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.0/dplyr"
```

---

# The Problem

--

By default, each **R** session uses the _same_ set of library paths.

--

![](img/shared-library.svg)

--

So if you were to install `dplyr 0.8.2`, that package would then become available in all three projects.

---

# The Problem

However, _different_ projects may have _different_ package dependencies. For example, suppose:

--

- **Project 1** requires `dplyr 0.7.8`,

--

- **Project 2** requires `dplyr 0.8.2`, and

--

- **Project 3** requires `dplyr 1.0.5`.

--

Because over time you've updated dplyr.  Unfortunately, these projects _share the same library paths_!

--

Hence, installing a newer versions of `dplyr` implies changing the version of `dplyr` used by **each** project.

--

This could spell disaster.....

---

# The Solution

The solution is to use _project-local libraries_, to ensure that each project gets its own unique library of **R** packages.

--

![](img/project-library.svg)

--

By using _project-local libraries_, you can rest assured that upgrading the packages used in one project will not risk breaking your other projects.

---

# The Solution: `renv`

--

- Gives each project its own _project-local library_

--

- Makes it simple and straightforward for **R** to use the _project-local library_,

--

- Provides tools for managing the **R** packages installed in these _project-local libraries_,

--

So "the experience is seamless and you can use `renv` without being an expert on `renv`".

--

--

Not quite, more on this later!

---

# Initializing a Project

The first step in activating `renv` for a project is:

--

```r
renv::init()
```

--

This function _**forks**_ the state of your default **R** libraries into a project-local library, and then prepares the infrastructure required to use `renv` in that project.

--

In particular, a project-local `.Rprofile` is created (or amended), which is then used by new **R** sessions to automatically initialize `renv` and ensure the project-local library is used.

--

After calling `renv::init()`, you can continue working **exactly as you did before.** The only difference is that packages will now be installed to, and loaded from, your **local** project library.

--

The library paths (as reported by `.libPaths()`) will now be changed.


```r
&gt; .libPaths()
[1] "C:/C-LOCAL/work-code/LeaRning/R-env-tutorial/renv/library/R-4.0/x86_64-w64-mingw32"
[2] "C:/Users/jcrosbie/AppData/Local/Temp/1/RtmpIJNCJE/renv-system-library"
```





--

- **Note** Under the new renv folder in the project directory is a copy of all the libraries.  add `renv/` to your `.gitignore` 






---

# Saving and Loading

The second goal is to make it possible to _save_ and _load_ the state of your project-local libraries.

--

In `renv` this is referred to as _snapshot_ and _restore_ .

--


```r
renv::snapshot()  # save the project's library state
renv::restore()   # load the project's library state
```

---


# Snapshot

You can capture the state of a project library using:

--

```r
&gt; renv::snapshot()
The following package(s) will be updated in the lockfile:

# CRAN ===============================
- markdown    [* -&gt; 1.1]
- rmarkdown   [* -&gt; 2.1]
- yaml        [* -&gt; 2.2.0]

Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
* Lockfile written to 'C:/C-LOCAL/work-code/LeaRning/R-env-tutorial/renv.lock'.
```

--

The state of your project library will be encoded into a _lockfile_, called `renv.lock`.

--

The _lockfile_ is a text (JSON) file, enumerating the packages installed in your project, their versions, and their _sources_.

---

# Lockfile Example

```json
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.0.1",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cran.rstudio.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "renv": {
      "Package": "renv",
      "Version": "0.9.2",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN"
    },
    &lt; ... other package records ... &gt;
  }
}
```

---

# Lockfiles

The lockfile encodes the information required to later recover and re-install packages as necessary. This is useful for:

--

- Time capsules, where you might want to freeze a project such that you can later return to the project with a record of the packages originally used to run the project,

--

- Collaborative workflows, where you might want to ensure all collaborators are working with the exact same set of packages, and

--

- Deployments, where you'd like to be sure that your project, when run remotely, uses the exact same set of packages that you were testing with locally.


---

# Restore

Given a lockfile `renv.lock` previously created by `renv::snapshot()`, you can restore the state of your project library using `renv::restore()`:

--

```r
&gt; renv::restore()
The following package(s) will be updated:

# CRAN ===============================
- markdown    [* -&gt; 1.1]
- rmarkdown   [* -&gt; 2.1]
- yaml        [* -&gt; 2.2.0]

Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
Installing markdown [1.1] ...
	OK (linked cache)
Installing yaml [2.2.0] ...
	OK (linked cache)
Installing rmarkdown [2.1] ...
	OK (linked cache)
```

--

Calling `renv::restore()` will download and re-install all of the declared packages as necessary.

---

# Restore

`renv` contains the machinery required to install packages from many sources, including:

--

- CRAN
- GitHub
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket
- etc

`renv` also understands how to authenticate with private repositories as well. See https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#authentication for more details.

---
# However 

--

`renv` does not play well with SharePoint.

--

Can lead to sync issues.

--

So, a suggested workflow is:

--

1. Use `renv::init()` to initialize a project with a project-local library,

--

2. Use `renv::snapshot()` to save the project-local library's state,

--

3. User `renv::deactivate()` to deactivate project.  This will keep the lockfile with the packages, but alters the .Rproj file to not use `renv`.

--

4. User `library(remotes)` and `install_version("emmeans", "1.4.5")` to install the specifc versions of the packages found in the lockfile.
