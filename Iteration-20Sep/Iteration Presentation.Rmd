# Recap - tibble

Last week Katie took you through functions in R using the example of a function to normalise a dataframe (or tibble).
--

You made a tibble with 4 columns (a-d), where each one was some random numbers:

```{r}
#create test dataframe
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

--

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(df)
```


???

---

# Recap - function

You then made a function which could normalise a column:

```{r}
# create the function rescale01 which 
# scales a vector to lie between 0 and 1
rescale01 <- function(x){
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE) # get min and max of col
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1]) # scale column
}
```

--

And talked about how you could apply it, one column at a time

```{r eval = FALSE}
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
```


---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Basic Iteration

---

# For Loops

This time we are going to talk about looping your functions. 
--
The basic recipe for a for loop is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (variable in sequence) { do_thing }
```

--

For example:

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) { print(i) }
```

--

In our example:

* iteration variable: `i`
* sequence: `1:3` (could also generate a sequence using seq)
* thing: `print` the value of `i`

???


---

# Ways to Loop - Indicies

There are a few different ways you can loop:

We started by looping over _indicies_, generating a sequence of numbers using the `:` operator.

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) { print(i) }
```


???

---

# Ways to Loop - Elements

We could also loop over the _elements_  of a list, generated using `list()` or a vector using `c()`
```{r}
example_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c')

```

--

```{r}
for (i in example_vector) { print(i) }
```

--

This is just a clearer and shorter way of achieving the same thing as:
```{r}
for (i in seq_along(example_vector)) { print(example_vector[[i]]) }
```

???

Note - key difference is that printing i in the first example would get you the element,
whereas printing i in the second example would give you 1,2,3.

---

# Note - seq_along

Note - `seq_along` just gives a list of indicies to use.

```{r}
seq_along(example_vector)
```

--

Its a safer version of `1:length(example_vector)`. You should use it instead.

```{r}
1:length(example_vector)
```

--

```{r}
empty_vec <- c()

for (i in seq_along(empty_vec) ) {print('foo')}
```

--

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(empty_vec)) {print('bar')}
```



???

safer in this case meaning it does the right thing if you have a zero-length vector.

1:length(empty_vec) gives 1,0

seq_along(empty_vec) gives an empty vector


---

# Ways to Loop - Names

Another variation on the theme is iterating on the _names_ of an object. 
--

If we create a named vector:
```{r}
a_named_vec <- c('a' = 3, 'b' = 2, 'c' = 1)
```

Then names can be used to index into it:
```{r}
a_named_vec[['b']]
```

--

So we can loop using the _name_:
```{r}
for (i in names(a_named_vec)) { 
  print(paste(i, ' = ' , a_named_vec[[i]]))
  }
```

# Looping a Function

---

# Applying our function using a loop

So, we have our rescale function we made last time
```{r}
rescale01
```

--

And a dataframe to apply it to
```{r}
head(df,3)
```

---

# Applying our function using a loop

To apply our function to all 4 columns we _could_ do:
```{r eval=FALSE}
df[[1]] <- rescale01(df[[1]])
df[[2]] <- rescale01(df[[2]])
df[[3]] <- rescale01(df[[3]])
df[[4]] <- rescale01(df[[4]])
```

--

Better - a simple loop:
```{r}
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale01(df[[i]])
}
```

--

We could also have used the names for indexing in our loop
```{r}
for (i in names(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale01(df[[i]])
}
```

???

The only difference is `df[[i]]` corresponds to `df[['a']]` rather than `df[[1]]`

---

# Less Code - Fewer Mistakes

As you can see, already, even when we are replacing just 4 operations, the loop is less code.

It is also able to handle a dataframe with an arbitrary number of columns. 

--

Finally, its much less likely to contain a copy & paste error. Its easy to make a mistake like: 
```{r}
df[[1]] <- rescale01(df[[1]])
df[[2]] <- rescale01(df[[2]])
df[[3]] <- rescale01(df[[2]])
df[[4]] <- rescale01(df[[4]])
```

# The `apply` Functions

---

# The `apply` functions

Writing a loop to iterate over and operate on each element of a vector or list is a common task.
R has some built in functions to help with that so you dont have to write loads of loops.

--

The key ones (`??apply` shows them all) are:

* `apply` - Apply Functions Over Array Margins (i.e. over rows or columns)
* `lapply` - Apply a Function over a List or Vector (returns a list)
* `sapply` - A wrapper for lapply which simplifies the output

--

Our toy examples are all _vectors_, and `df` is a _dataframe_ which, can be thought of as a list of columns, (which can also be lists). 

As such, we can use `lapply` to do all of the examples we have covered so far.

???

...so how do you lapply?

---

# `lapply` syntax

The syntax for lapply is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
lapply(X, FUN, ...)
```

* X - input list or vector - other inputs are coerced to a list using `as.list()`
* FUN - a function we want to apply
* ... - other inputs to FUN

---

# lapply example

So, instead of writing a loop, to print each item of our example vector we can do:
```{r message=FALSE}
lapply(example_vector, print) -> output_list
```

--
In this case, we get two outputs, print produces a side effect (printing to the console) as well as a direct output - a list, containing the printed contents of each item in example vector.

--

So that we see only one of these (the printing to console), I have sent the output of `lapply` to 'output_list'. Otherwise R would print it out.

---

# `lapply` on columns

We can also use lapply to apply each of the columns in df:
```{r}
output_of_lapply <- lapply(df, rescale01)
```

--

Note - this has returned a list, rather than a dataframe, but we can use `as.data.frame()` to convert it back:
```{r}
df_from_list <- as.data.frame(output_of_lapply)
```

--

```{r}
head(df_from_list)
```

---

# `apply` example

We could also use apply, telling it to work on the 2nd margin (columns), to achieve the same thing:

```{r}
output_of_apply <- apply(df, 2, rescale01)
```

--

This has returned a matrix so we convert it back to a dataframe:

```{r}
df_from_matrix <- as.data.frame(output_of_apply)
```

--

```{r}
head(df_from_matrix)
```

???

If you did apply(df, 1, rescale01) you would rescale row by row.

# tidyverse + `apply` = `purrr`

---

# purrr

`purrr` is a part of the _tidyverse_ and provides extensive functionality for iterating.

```{r}
library(purrr)
```

--

The most basic purrr function is `map`
```{r}
output_of_map <-
  map(.x = df, 
      .f = rescale01)
```

--

`map` does the same thing as `lapply`: it applies a function to each element of a list.
```{r}
all.equal(output_of_map, output_of_lapply)
```

---

# `map`
The advantage of `map()` is all the other versions of it!
```{r eval=FALSE}
map(.x, .f, ...)
```
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
# conditional
map_if(.x, .p, .f, ..., .else = NULL)
map_at(.x, .at, .f, ...)
```
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
# atomic vectors - will return a list of a given type or die trying
map_lgl(.x, .f, ...) 
map_chr(.x, .f, ...)
map_int(.x, .f, ...)
map_dbl(.x, .f, ...)
```
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
# return a dataframe directly
map_df(.x, .f, ...)

# like map, but returns the input, invisibly, 
# useful for side effects like print, or plot.
walk(.x, .f, ...) 
```

---

# `map_df`

This means that instead of our loop, or our lapply & conversion we can simply use `map_df()` to return our scaled dataframe:
```{r}
output_of_map_df <- map_df(df, rescale01)
```

--

The output is exactly the same:
```{r}
all.equal(output_of_map_df, df_from_list)
```

# The Elephant in the Room

As it turns out, applying a function to multiple columns is something that is required all the time.


This means our example is quite easy to do using regular `dplyr`, without the `map` or `apply` functions: 

```{r}
dplyr_output <- dplyr::mutate_all(df, rescale01)

```

--

Its exactly the same:
```{r}
all.equal(output_of_map_df, dplyr_output)
```

???

I would encourage people to check out all of the different versions of the dplyr verbs - lots of useful things in there!

# So what is `purrr` for?

---

# So what is purrr for?

Purr has lots more functionality that we havent talked about yet!

--

Our example so far has been using functions which have a single input only.
But what if we have multiple inputs to our function? 

--

Lets imagine we wanted to generate a list of 4 sets of random numbers, with different parameters.

```{r}
mean_vals <- c(1,2,4,8)
sd_vals   <- c(2,2,5,5)
```

--

You can generate distrubutions as we did when we made our test dataframe using `rnorm`:
```{r eval = FALSE}
rnorm(n, # number of samples
      mean = 0,
      sd = 1)
```


---

# The Hard Ways - Do Each Case

So, how could we make our list?

The simplest way would be to do each case yourself:
```{r eval = FALSE}
dist_list_basic <- list() # create empty list

dist_list_basic[[1]] <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 1, sd = 2)
dist_list_basic[[2]] <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 2, sd = 2)
dist_list_basic[[3]] <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 4, sd = 5)
dist_list_basic[[4]] <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 8, sd = 5)
```


???

---

# The Hard Ways - Loops

You could also write a loop:
```{r}
dist_list_loop <- list() # create empty list

for (i in seq_along(mean_vals)) {
  
    dist_list_loop[[i]] <-
      rnorm(
        n = 10,
        mean = mean_vals[[i]],
        sd = sd_vals[[i]]
      )
}
```

---

# Easy with `map2()`

map2() lets us pass in two arguments to the function, and iterate on both at once.

--

```{r}
dist_list_map <-
  map2(.x = mean_vals,
       .y = sd_vals,
       .f = rnorm, 
       n = 10) # arguments after the function are repeated
```

--

Note that `n = 10` is provided **after** `.f` and is therefore kept constant, 
while `.x` and `.y` are **before** `.f` because there is a new `.x` and `.y` for each iteration.

--

This works because `n` is labelled explicitly - and the remaining arguments for `rnorm()` (`mean` and `sd`) are matched by position.

???

---

# More Explicit `map2()`

If you wanted to be more explicit about it you could use a formula `~` instead:
```{r eval = FALSE}
dist_list_map <-
  map2(.x = mean_vals,
       .y = sd_vals,
       .f = ~rnorm( n = 10,
                    mean = .x,
                    sd = .y)
  )
```

--

If you wanted to write the shortest possible thing you could do it on one line:
```{r eval = FALSE}
dist_list_map <- map2(mean_vals, sd_vals, rnorm, n = 10)
```

--

Please dont.

# Modelling Example

# Modelling example - Model

Working with lists using map, lets you do some really neat stuff.

--

In this example, we: 
* Take the mtcars dataset, 

* Split it into a list of three dataframes <br> (depending on if there are 4, 6 or 8 cylinders)

* Fit a model to each of the dataframes in the list using map

* ...producing a list of model objects

--

```{r split mtcars by cylinder}
by_cylinder <-  split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
```

--

```{r fit a linear model to each part of the split df}
models_list <-  map(.x = by_cylinder, 
               .f = ~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)) 
```

???

note - formula interface used in front of lm so we can pass in `.x`

---
# Modelling Example - Predict

You can then use map2 to call `predict` to take each of our models, and each bit of the split data, and make predictions.

```{r make predictions of mpg using our models and partial dataframes}
predictions <-
  map2( .x = models_list,      # a model
        .y = by_cylinder,      # corresponding bit of data frame
        .f = predict)          # function to apply
```

--

The first element of our predictions list contains the mpg predictions for the 4 cylinder cars:

```{r}
predictions[[1]]
```


---

# `pmap() `
So thats pretty neat, but what if you wanted to work with more than 2 inputs?

(Previous example used `map`, then `map2`)
--

`purrr` lets you do that using `pmap`. With `pmap` you can provide a **list** of input vectors (or lists) to map a function over.

--

We have a name for a lists of associated input lists/vectors - a dataframe!

You can pass pmap a dataframe of inputs and it can apply a function to it.

--

`pmap` in this case is taking each row, and using the values each columns as arguments to your function.

# Its All Loops

Under the hood, when you use these purrr functions, it is generating and running for loops, so map etc wont make things magically faster than a nested loop.

--

What purrr *does* bring to the table is the fact that its easer to read, understand and change your code.

# Mapping Safely

---

# Mapping Safely!
When you use the map functions to repeat many operations, the chances are much higher that one of those operations will fail. 

--

When this happens, you’ll get an error message, and no output.

--

So - you need a way to handle the failures.

--

Fortunately purrr has a way of doing this.

---

# The Problem

In this example we have a list of what we *think* are all numbers, 
```{r}
input_list <- list(10, 11, 12, 10, '14')

```

--

Lets imagine we wanted to multiply them all by 10, and the best way to do this was to write a function to do it:

--

```{r}
multiply_10 <- function(number) { number * 10 }
```

--

We could then use `map` to apply our function to our input:

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
map(input_list, multiply_10)
```

--

Unfortunately, when we get to '14' we get:

`Error in number * 10 : non-numeric argument to binary operator`

--

This means we dont get any of our results.

---


# The Solution

We can use `safely()` to provide some error handling by creating a new function, which always returns a _list_:

```{r}
safe_multiply <- safely(multiply_10)
```

--

If our function works the list contains the result and a `NULL` error, 

```{r}
safe_multiply(10)
```

???


---

# The Solution

If it breaks, the list contains a NULL result and the error text.
```{r}
safe_multiply('14')
```

--

Crucially, this allows R to keep plugging away at the rest of our list, rather than coming to a halt.

--

So, our new function is _safe_ to use with `map()` because it wont bring everything down if it comes across a problem. 

Instead `map()` can just rise above it and move on.

---


# Getting at Your Results

This now works:

```{r}
map_output <- map(input_list, safe_multiply)
```

--

So far so good, but how do you get at your results? They are in a format which isnt super convenient.
```{r}
map_output[[1]]
```


???


---

# `transpose`

`purrr` provides the `transpose` function which restructures our list so that we can get all of our results or errors easily:
```{r}
results <- transpose(map_output)[['result']]
errors  <- transpose(map_output)[['error']]
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
results
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
errors
```
]

---

# `compact`

These transposed lists still contain the NULL results, we can filter these out using `compact()` to get simple lists of the result and errors only.
```{r}
results <- compact(results)
errors <- compact(errors)
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
results
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
errors
```
]

---

# Other Uses

This is probably overkill for this example, but `safely` & `map` can be applied to all sorts of things.

--

For example, you might use them to read a folder full of spreadsheets, returning the errors rather than breaking your script when it finds one it cant read.
